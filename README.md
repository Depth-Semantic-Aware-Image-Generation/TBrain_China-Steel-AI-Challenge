# TBrain_China-Steel-AI-Challenge
Participants must develop an AI algorithm to recognize printed or handwritten serial numbers on steel billets. This will aid in tracing issues and quality control. The system should identify printed serial numbers (digits and letters) and handle handwritten, inverted, duplicated, or blurred serial numbers for production line use.
